# LatexTemplate

This is the template project for a latex. Actually, latex is a very powerful too to write any kind of articles, documents, reports, thesis or books. 

Latex is very good tool, but installation is a bit cumbersome process, the full size is huge, it is a bit confusion with the folder structure in your local machine.

Also, we focus on our business of creating articles or reports without being interuppted by the settings and configuration needed for the latex. Again, repeating the same
for every machine is cumbursome.

This problem has been greatly solved using the container technology. I have written a docker file for that, the image is alreay uploaded into dockerhub. This can be easily downloaded using

docker pull krishna444/latex

So, we can run container using this image and execute latex commands there in the running container. The generated files will be shown in the output directory.
